# Hi, I'm Conrad 👋

Physics Ph.D. Candidate at **The Ohio State University** specializing in ultrafast lasers, nonlinear photonics, laser material processing, and computational modeling. I bridge the gap between complex physical systems and data-driven insights.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
- **Machine Learning for Micromachining:** Utilizing Bayesian optimization to automate and optimize high-aspect-ratio glass processing.
- **Computational Physics:** Developing a 3D n-Two-Temperature Model (nTTM) in Python to numerically simulate extreme laser-matter interactions.
- **Laser-Material Interaction Analysis:** Performing and evaluating laser-induced damage from UV to Mid-IR on wide range of materials. Developed statistical workflows to integrate AFM, SEM, and Raman datasets, quantifying structural degradation and material phase stability.
- **SpotGauge:** An open-source tool for algorithmic analysis of laser beam profiles.


### 🛠 Technical Toolkit
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), MATLAB, R, C, Mathematica.
- **Data & ML:** Bayesian Optimization, Predictive Modeling, Machine Vision, High-Dimensional Data Analysis.
- **Engineering:** Hardware automation (Serial/USB), Lab instrumentation interfacing, 3D printing/CAD.

### 🏛 Leadership
- **President**, OSU SPIE Student Chapter: Building a community for photonics and optics researchers.
